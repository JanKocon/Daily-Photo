# Daily-Photo
A mobile application for recording visual changes taking place over time.

Daily Photo allows you to create a memorable video from your life.
Take daily photos and notice how things change over time.
App works with Google Drive storage that allows to create backups, so changing the mobile devices has no effect on long term usage.
The application contains a notification system that reminds user to take a photo every day.
The implemented calendar and statistics system provide a clear preview of user progress in time.
###

- [Google Drive Android API](https://developers.google.com/drive/android/intro) (backup data)
- [Resizer](https://github.com/hkk595/Resizer) (image compression)
- [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) (image caching library)
- [FFmpeg](https://github.com/WritingMinds/ffmpeg-android-java) (create timelapse from list of photos)
